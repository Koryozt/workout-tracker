# Workout Tracker

Workout tracker API made with ASP.NET. Using packages like EntityFramework, JWT Token bearer and SQL Server as database, this API is designed to track all the data of the exercises, routines and data of a User, letting him to access to his own saved routines. I recommend a lot to use postman to test the API instead of swagger.

### Features:

 - Basic CRUD operations.
 - Authentication and authorization included.
 - Avaliable to connect with the Frontend.
